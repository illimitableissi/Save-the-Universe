Thanos is back to reclaim the Infinity Stones and disrupt the stability of the universe.

The object of this game is to match the displayed number on the screen by clicking on the stones. Each stone has a different numerical value and they must add up to reach the target number.

With every loss Thanos will acquire an infinity stone. You must keep him from gaining all 4 stones or the game will be over.
